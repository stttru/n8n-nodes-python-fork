## üö® CRITICAL DANGER: 100% AI-GENERATED CODE üö®
**DANGER - ALL FORK MODIFICATIONS CREATED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**: 100% of the modifications and new features in this fork were developed with AI assistance. This includes:
- **ALL NEW FEATURE IMPLEMENTATIONS** - Complex logic that may contain hidden flaws
- **ALL CODE REFACTORING AND IMPROVEMENTS** - Structural changes that may introduce bugs
- **ALL DOCUMENTATION AND COMMENTS** - May not accurately reflect actual code behavior
- **ALL BUG FIXES AND ENHANCEMENTS** - Solutions that may create new, undetected issues

**CRITICAL IMPLICATIONS & RISKS**:
- **UNTESTED CODE PATTERNS** - May appear functional but fail under specific conditions
- **SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** - AI cannot guarantee secure coding practices or identify all attack vectors
- **LOGIC ERRORS** - Complex interactions between features may not be properly validated
- **PERFORMANCE ISSUES** - Code may not be optimized and could cause system slowdowns
- **UNDOCUMENTED SIDE EFFECTS** - AI-generated code may have behaviors not captured in documentation
- **COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS** - May not work correctly with all n8n versions or system configurations

**MANDATORY SAFETY REQUIREMENTS**:
- **ISOLATED TESTING MANDATORY** - Never use in production without extensive testing in isolated environments
- **SECURITY AUDIT REQUIRED** - All AI-generated code portions should be audited for security vulnerabilities
- **FUNCTIONALITY VALIDATION** - Test every feature critical to your use case thoroughly
- **MONITORING ESSENTIAL** - Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring when using this software
- **BACKUP SYSTEMS REQUIRED** - Never rely on this software as a single point of failure

**Recommendation**: Treat this software as **EXPERIMENTAL** and **HIGH-RISK**. Thoroughly test and review any code before use in any environment where reliability or security is important.

## Major Modifications Made

### Architectural Changes (100% AI-generated new code)
1. **Complete execution model rewrite**: From python-fire wrapper to raw Python execution
2. **New feature systems**: Output file processing, multiple credentials, advanced debugging
3. **Enhanced error handling**: Comprehensive Python error parsing and reporting
4. **Smart output parsing**: JSON/CSV/Lines auto-detection with fallback mechanisms
5. **Variable injection system**: Auto-extraction of input data fields as Python variables

### New Features Added
- **Output File Processing System** (v1.11.0+): Generate and capture files from Python scripts
- **Multiple Credentials Management** (v1.9.0+): Use multiple Python Environment Variables simultaneously
- **Advanced Debug System** (v1.12.0+): File debugging, system info, script export
- **File Detection Modes**: Ready Variable Path and Auto Search modes
- **Script Export Options**: Download executed scripts as .py or .txt files
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive unit, functional, and integration tests

### Files Modified
- `nodes/PythonFunction/PythonFunction.node.ts` - **100% AI-GENERATED MODIFICATIONS** (all new features)
- `credentials/PythonEnvVars.credentials.ts` - **AI-MODIFIED**
- `package.json` - **AI-MODIFIED** for new features and dependencies
- `README.md` - **100% AI-REWRITTEN**
- Multiple test files - **100% AI-CREATED**
